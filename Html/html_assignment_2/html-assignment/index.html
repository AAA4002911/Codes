    <h1>Why do I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        I want to be a software developer because I love computers. The one thing that always amazed me is that how these machines work, how they help humans to make their life better. I wanted to learn all the languages they speaks and all the crazy things they do to simplified our daily task. <br> After graduating I've decide to follow this as a career becuase software industry is on high demand and it provides one the opportunity of always learning.
